# Recipe Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a Recipe Recommendation System that suggests recipes based on the ingredients provided by the user. The main feature of the system is to recommend recipes using a cosine similarity algorithm. Additionally, the website allows users to customize the theme by choosing between dark and light themes, adjusting the color scheme, and changing the font. The frontend of the website is built using React, while SCSS is used for styling. The recommendation engine is implemented using Flask and cosine similarity.
